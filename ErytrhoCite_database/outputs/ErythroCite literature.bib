	abstract = {This study aims to compare the size of the red blood cells of different freshwater fishes to gain knowledge of their activity. In this study, 11 different freshwater fishes of four different order like Siluriformes, Cypriniformes, Perciformes, and Osteoglossiformes were selected. For analyses of cytomorphometry of blood cells, blood was collected from caudal vein, and blood smear was prepared at the site of collection. In order to obtain size of different blood cell types, 30 cells of each cell type for each fish were photographed and dimensions of cell-like length and breadth were measured using Microscope Eyepiece Digital Camera (CatCam130 – 1.3 Mega Pixel (MP), Code No. CC130, Catalyst Biotech, Maharashtra, India, attached to Hund Wetzlar Microscope GmbH, Wetzlar-Nauborn, Germany) and computer. This study confirms the cytomorphometry of red blood cells differ significantly at p{\textless} 0.001 concerning sex and species. The study will help in diagnosis which in turn will accelerate production of fishes. © 2019 African Journal of Biological Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This investigation presents an overview of the effect of sex on haematobiochemical and haemocytomorphometrical aspects of Datnioides polota. For the present study, 15 males and 15 females of Datnioides polota were collected from Balugaon, the central sector of Chilika lagoon of Odisha. Two millilitres of blood samples was collected from each sex through the caudal vein. One millilitre of collected blood was transferred from the syringe into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing vials, for haematological studies and other 1 ml was taken in Eppendorf tube without anticoagulant for analyses of biochemical parameters. Haematological parameters like red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cells count (WBC), haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), biochemical parameters such as glucose, protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, and morphometrical parameters namely length, breadth, area, and N/C ratio of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils are analysed in relation to the sex of the fish. Statistical analysis reveals the sex wise significant difference in some haematological parameters like Hb which varies at P {\textless} 0.01 level while WBC deviate at P {\textless} 0.05 level. All the biochemical parameters show higher value in females in comparison to males except albumin but sex wise significant variation recorded in protein and globulin at P {\textless} 0.01 level. In males, the concentration of Hb is positively correlated with RBC and PCV while in females negatively correlated. RBC is positively correlated with PCV in both the sexes at R2 = 0.008 and R2 = 0.9 in male and female, respectively. The morphometry of blood cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes shows significant sexual dimorphism. The cellular length and area of monocytes deviate at the level of P {\textless} 0.01 and breadth at P {\textless} 0.05 level. The cellular and nuclear breadth of lymphocyte vary significantly at the level of P {\textless} 0.05 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively. The results of this study may serve as a reference value for haemocytological and biochemical parameters of this species which in turn helps in diagnosing diseases and increasing fish production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

Blood samples from the caudal vein of apparently healthy Siamese fighting fish (male: n = 40 and female: n = 36) were collected. Haematological values of the blood samples were determined using standard techniques. The morphological features of blood cells were described according to observations made by light microscopy. The various types of blood cells measurement were carried out with the help of a stage and an ocular micrometre at a magnification of ×1,000. Erythrocytes, thrombocytes and four types of leucocytes: lymphocytes, monocytes, heterophils and eosinophils, were distinguished and characterised. The average size of the erythrocyte cell and nucleus was 97.33 and 16.28 μm 2, respectively. Results showed a positive correlation between erythrocyte size and nucleus size for Siamese fighting fish (r = 0.470, p{\textless}0.01). We also found sex-dependent differences for total white blood cell count, lymphocytes and heterophils in Siamese fighting fish (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {The size and shape of red blood cells (RBCs) provide key information on life-history strategies in vertebrates. However, little is known about how RBC shape evolved in response to environmental factors, body size and the role of evolutionary rate. Here, we analysed RBC morphometrics in a set of Teleostei (bony fishes) and Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) species testing the hypothesis that phylogenetic relationship explains species occupation of morphospace. We collected data on cell and nucleus area and volume, nucleus:cytoplasm ratio and shape factor for 65 species belonging to 28 orders. Then, we built phylomorphospaces separately for bony fish and sharks and rays. To test whether phylogenetic relationships predicted phenotypic similarity, we calculated multivariate phylogenetic signal. We also estimated the evolutionary rate of RBC shape for each node and tip using ridge regression. Finally, we tested whether habitat and body size influenced RBC shape using a PGLS. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in RBC shape for bony fish, but not sharks and rays. Saltwater teleost species were more clustered than freshwater ones in the phylomorphospace, suggesting clade disparity. Accordingly, the rate of evolution was highly heterogeneous, with significant decrease in Acanthopterygii. Neither habitat nor body size influenced RBC shape. In conclusion, RBC shape seems to have evolved in fishes in response to multiple selective pressures independent of life-history characters.},

A functional basis for this relationship is found in larger surface area to volume ratios and shorter diffusion distances allowing more rapid oxygen transfer as erythrocyte volume decreases. However, this apparently simple functional relationship is confounded by a more general direct relationship between cell size and nuclear volume. Nuclear DNA content, which is directly proportional to nuclear volume, is known to vary at least 11 fold among teleost species. Therefore a question arises as to the relative contributions of nuclear volume and the demands of the blood oxygen delivery system in determining erythrocyte volume. These relationships were investigated by regressing erythrocyte volume against nuclear volume and whole blood haemoglobin concentration (as an index of aerobic scope) for 52 species of teleost fish from 25 families. This analysis shows that erythrocyte volume is more highly correlated with oxygen delivery than with nuclear volume. However, much of the variation in erythrocyte volume is unexplained.},

	abstract = {The metabolic-level boundaries (MLB) hypothesis and the cell metabolism (CM) hypothesis have been proposed to explain the body mass scaling of metabolic rate. The MLB hypothesis focuses mainly on the influence of the metabolic level on the relative importance of volume and surface area constraints. The CM hypothesis focuses on the variation of cell size as the body grows. The surface area to volume ratio of individual cells may vary among species with different cell sizes, by which surface area constraints on metabolic scaling may change according to the MLB hypothesis. The present study aimed to extend the MLB and the CM hypotheses by proposing that, in addition to metabolic level, the varying cell surface area constraints among species also influence the intraspecific scaling exponents. The red blood cell area (S), and intraspecific scaling exponents for resting (b(R)) and maximum metabolic rates of four species of cyprinids were assessed. The scaling exponents varied among species, but mass-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR) of each species were similar. No significant correlation was found between S and mass-specific RMR among species. As predicted, a significantly negative relationship exists between S and bR among species. The results suggest that the varying bR could be attributed to cell size differences among species, as those with larger cells may face stronger surface boundary limits, as predicted by the MLB hypothesis. This mechanism represents an additional way of relating the MLB and the CM hypotheses and does not exclude another mechanism based on the recent contextual multimodal theory.},

The black scorpionfish Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus, 1758 and the shore rockling Gaidropsarus mediterraneus Linnaeus, 1758 differed from the other species in a larger mass of the heart and gill apparatus, which indicates more efficient transport capabilities of the circulatory system of these fish. The linear size characteristics of erythrocytes of a cartilaginous fish, the thornback ray Raja clavata Linnaeus, 1758, were 1.5-2 times higher than those of erythrocytes of S. porcus, which were the largest among the studied teleosts. The sizes of the erythrocytes of three other teleost species differed insignificantly. The amount of hemoglobin per unit surface area of erythrocyte, which reflects the efficiency of hemoglobin saturation with oxygen, insignificantly varied (0.05 to 0.071 pg/mm(2)) among the studied bony fish. In contrast, in the thornback ray this parameter was 2.7-3.8 times lower. The intracellular glycogen concentration, which characterizes the degree to which the erythrocyte is independent of glycemic fluctuations, was highest in cells of S. porcus (305.2 \& PLUSMN; 35.1 mg \%), while it was lowest in erythrocytes of the thornback ray R. clavata (142.8 \& PLUSMN; 15.1 mg \%). The ecto-ATPase activity was higher in large erythrocytes of S. porcus, R. clavata, and Uranoscopus scaber (4.8, 3.1, and 1.6 \& mu;mol P-in/min/mL of erythrocytes, respectively) than in smaller erythrocytes of Crenilabrus tinca and Gaidropsarus mediterraneus (0.5 and 0.4, \& mu;mol P-in/min/mL of erythrocytes, respectively). This confirms the assumption that erythrocytes use the thermal energy from hydrolysis of extracellular ATP to "warm" their own membrane, which leads to the change in the rheological characteristics of blood in the capillary blood flow.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare methods of analyzing changes in red blood cell volume when exposed to osmotic challenge. STUDY DESIGN: The sensitivity of different methods was tested using fish erythrocytes under hypoosmotic stress (80\% and 60\% saline): hematocrit ratio, Hcto(exp)/Hcto(ctr); cellular hemoglobin mean concentration; optical density (OD400); water content; surface area estimation; mean corpuscular volume (MCV); and mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH). RESULTS: Cells exposed to both solutions demonstrated a volume increase via hematocrit ratio of 16 +/- 2\% and 30 +/- 3\% (p {\textless} 0.001) when exposed to 80\% and 60\% saline, respectively. Cellular volume estimation by OD400 revealed a change in volume only at 60\% saline (26\% increase). Surface area estimation suggested a difference in volume at 60\% saline. MCV revealed differences in volume at {\textless} 60\% saline exposure with a 33\% increase and indicated a 19\% increase at 80\% saline. MCH showed an increase of 48\% with exposure to 80\% saline. CONCLUSION: The results reveal that Hcto(ctr)/Hcto(exp') MCV, OD400 and MCH yield significant volume changes and that Hcto(ctr)/Hcto(exp) is the most sensitive assay.},

Regardless of the dye used, the more evolutionarily advanced species had a smaller genome size than those with a lower evolutionary status. For each species, we also measured the size of erythrocytes and their nucleus and evaluated the relationships between erythrocyte size, nucleus size, chromosome number, and genome size. Genome size was positively correlated with erythrocyte nucleus size and chromosome number when using PI as the fluorescent dye, but it was only correlated with erythrocyte nucleus size when DAPI was used.},

Increase in ploidy was accompanied by growth of the nucleus and an increase in the number of flattened ellipsoid nuclei with increased transverse diameter. The volume (V-voxel) of erythrocyte nuclei, as the sum of voxels calculated from live cells, seems more accurate than volume (V-axis) calculated from measuring the major and minor axis, especially at higher and odd ploidy levels. Data of absolute and relative DNA content were in agreement with previously published reports. Species of the same ploidy level, but differing in DNA content, had a similar mean erythrocyte nuclear volume (V-voxel), as demonstrated in sterlet and a hybrid of sterlet and beluga (48.3 and 48.9m(3), respectively), with a respective mean DNA content of 3.74 and 3.10pg DNA nucleus(-1). A similar relationship was found for the ploidy 6n, 10n, 12n. The surface-to-volume ratio decreased non-linearly with increasing ploidy.

Marked differences were found in the flow of yellowtail blood which depended on the particular way in which the blood had been sampled. Such differences seem to be due to a sensitivity of fish red blood cells to their environmental conditions. Blood flow through filters is temperature-dependent, the rate increasing with a rise in temperature. Measurements made at 37.degree. C gave values which were similar to those normally obtained for human red blood cells, in spite of their greater dimensions (10.4 .times. 6.8 .times. 3.4 .mu.m) and nucleated nature.

Na(2)EDTA significantly increased ROS production but no effect of anticoagulants on WBC, PLT or differential leukocyte count was observed. The obtained results show that Na(2)EDTA should not be used for evaluation of red blood cell parameters and erythrocyte morphology, and for ROS production measurement in common carp.

The results suggest that a process of senescence takes place in the pre-existent red blood cells and that the cells are not replaced during starvation. After 240 days of starvation, H. malabaricus had a significantly reduced number of red blood cells, causing changes in hematocrit and blood indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration). Furthermore, during this period, the fish presented leukopenia (lymphocytopenia) and thrombocytopenia.

This study is aimed to provide baseline data of the blood profile of two teleost fish species living in different environments and with divergent feeding behaviour, namely the flathead grey mullet Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758, a marine herbivorous fish, and the goldfish Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758), a freshwater omnivorous fish. Using an automated system coupled with flow cytometry and light microscopy, significant variations were found between M. cephalus and C. auratus blood parameters, except for haemoglobin concentration (Hgb). A significant increase in red blood cell count (RBC) and haematocrit (Hct) levels, associated with reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), was revealed in mullets in respect to goldfish. These data may be attributable to differences in fish species, or to their divergent physiological activeness as high RBC values are associated with fast movement and high activity with streamlined bodies, or to environmental factors such as water salinity, an increase in which may lead to erythropoiesis as an adaptive process in seawater fish. Additionally, lower values of white blood cell count (WBC) and thrombocyte count (TC) were recorded in mullets with respect to goldfish, and these changes may be due to divergent feeding habits of the two fish species, or to their different environments since increased salinity may inversely affect WBC. Overall, findings from this study provide a better understanding of the influences of divergent environmental conditions and feeding habits on fish blood parameters. The combined use of an automatic haematological count with flow cytometry was demonstrated to be effective for an early assessment of blood parameters in different fish species.},

Standards and investigated cells were stained with a mixture of propidium iodide, citric acid, and Nonidet P40 in the presence of RNAse, and fluorescence of at least 50,000 nuclei was analyzed by flow cytometry. Average cell size was determined by flow cytometry, using fresh cell suspension in relation to latex beads of known diameter. The size of nuclei was examined on the basis of digital micrographs obtained by fluorescence microscopy after nuclei staining with DAPI. The sunbleak's erythrocyte nuclei contain 2.25 +/- 0.06 pg of DNA, whereas the hepatocyte nuclei contain 2.46 +/- 0.06 pg of DNA. This difference in DNA content was determined spectroscopically using isolated DNA from the two cell types.

	abstract = {Animals inhabiting extreme environments allow the powerful opportunity to examine adaptive evolution in response to diverse pressures. One such pressure is reduced oxygen, commonly present at high-altitude and subterranean environments. Cave-dwelling animals must also deal with darkness and starvation, both of which have been rigorously studied as key forces driving the evolution of cave-associated traits. Interestingly, hypoxia as an environmental pressure has received less attention. Here we examined putatively adaptive phenotypes evolving in a freshwater teleost fish, Astyanax mexicanus, which includes both surface- and cave-dwelling forms. This model system also provides the opportunity to identify convergent responses to hypoxia, owing to the presence of numerous natural and independently-colonised cave populations, alongside closely-related surface conspecifics. The focus of this study is hemoglobin, an essential molecule for oxygen transport and delivery. We found that multiple cave populations harbor a higher concentration of hemoglobin in their blood, which is coincident with an increase in cave morph erythrocyte size compared to surface fish. Interestingly, both cave and surface morphs have comparable numbers of erythrocytes per unit of blood, suggesting elevated hemoglobin is not due to overproduction of red blood cells. Alternatively, owing to an increased cell area of erythrocytes in cavefish, we reason that they contain more hemoglobin per erythrocyte. These findings support the notion that cavefish have adapted to hypoxia in caves through modulation of both hemoglobin production and erythrocyte size. This work reveals an additional adaptive feature of Astyanax cavefish, and demonstrates that coordinated changes between cellular architecture and molecular changes are necessary for organisms evolving under intense environmental pressure.},

	abstract = {Recovery from anaerobic exercise is thought to be prolonged in elasmobranchs because they lack several mechanisms for maintaining or increasing oxygen delivery that are present in teleosts. For example, teleosts increase hematocrit and maximal blood-oxygen carrying capacity through red cell ejection from the spleen. Teleosts also counteract the reduction in hemoglobin oxygen affinity resulting from metabolic acidosis through an adrenergic-mediated increase in red cell Na+-H+ exchanger activity. To begin to assess the consequences of anaerobic exercise accompanying catch-and-release fishing occurring within the estuarine nursery habitats of juvenile sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus, Nardo), we constructed blood-oxygen equilibrium curves using samples from individuals I h after capture by hook and line (exercise-stressed) and samples from fully-recovered animals maintained in a shore-side tank (control sharks). We also compared exercise-stressed and control sharks for hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red cell count, intracellular pH, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration ([NTP]). In contrast to results from previous studies on elasmobranchs, we found an elevation in both hematocrit (approximate to 21\%) and blood hemoglobin concentration (approximate to 10\%) in exercise-stressed sharks. There was also clear evidence of red cell swelling. Mean red cell volume was approximate to 28\% higher and mean cell hemoglobin concentration was approximate to 10\% lower in exercise-stressed sharks. Most important, in spite of significant metabolic acidosis (0.3 pH units), blood from exercise-stressed sharks had an oxygen affinity equivalent to that of blood from control sharks. This was a direct consequence of intracellular pH being alkalinized. by approximately 0.15 pH units relative to plasma pH in exercise-stressed sharks. Our results using isolated hemoglobin solutions showed that the observed reduction (approximate to 15\%) in intracellular [NTP] also contributed to the leftward shift in the oxygen equilibrium curves. As expected, we found sandbar shark red cells to be unresponsive to exogenous catecholamines. Regardless, sandbar sharks appear able to prevent the decrease in blood-oxygen affinity resulting from anaerobic exercise (and the concomitant decreases in plasma pH), as has been well-documented in teleosts. Our results suggest, therefore, that oxygen delivery following exhaustive exercise is not necessarily compromised in juvenile sandbar sharks, and that hook and line capture and subsequent release do not increase rates of mortality, although both are yet to be directly confirmed.

	abstract = {Chromium is considered the most detrimental pollutant to the aquatic organisms. The present experiment was conducted to determine the acute toxicity of chromium in view of its effects on hemato-biochemical parameters and the structure of erythrocytes in striped catfish, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. Fish were exposed to seven different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mg/L) of chromium, each with three replications for 96 h. After 96 h of exposure, the survived fish were sacrificed to measure hemato-biochemical parameters (hemoglobin, Hb; red blood cell, RBC; white blood cell, WBC; packed cell volume, PCV; mean corpuscular volume, MCV; the mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH and blood glucose). In addition, erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) of peripheral erythrocytes were assayed. No mortality was observed up to 10 mg/L, but 90\% and 100\% mortality was observed at 50 mg/L and 60 mg/L, respectively after a 96 h exposure period. The 96 h LC50 value through probit analysis was 32.47 mg/L. Hb (\%), RBC (x10(6)/mm(3)) and PCV (\%) significantly decreased at 20, 30 and 40 mg/L of chromium, whereas WBC (x10(3)/mm(3)), MCV (mu m(3)) and MCH (pg) showed the opposite scenario. Blood glucose (mg/dL) levels significantly increased at 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/L of chromium compared to 0 mg/L. Frequencies of ECA and ENA significantly increased with increasing chromium concentrations. This study indicates that chromium is highly toxic to striped catfish.},

Considering the above fact, the present study has been under taken to investigate the alteration of some blood parameters of freshwater teleost Mystus vittatus after chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of Metasystox (4 ppm.) and Sevin (7 ppm.) individually. The main alterations observed in certain haematological parameters were clotting time (CT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin percentage (Hb\%), red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white blood corpuscles (WBCs), pack cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Alterations in organic constituents of blood, such as glucose, blood urea, total plasma protein and cholesterol, and in inorganic constituents, such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, were also studied. Alteration of enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-pase), fructose-1-6-diphosphatase (F-1-6-dipase), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) were also studied, so that the changes in the blood biochemistry due to the pesticidal stress could be understood. Results indicated that CT, WBCs, MCH, MCHC, glucose, blood urea, cholesterol, magnesium and SGOT were increased, whereas other parameters were found to be decreased in both cases. Possible reasons for the above elevation are discussed in the light of available literature.},

Red blood cell counts (RBCc), haematocrit values (Hct), haemoglobin concentrations (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were measured and analyzed. The calculated intervals of the reference ranges between the lower and upper quantiles were: RBCc 0.87 - 1.34 T. 1(-1), Hct 0.36 - 0.554, Hb 64 - 107 g. 1(-1), MCV 347 - 501 fl, MCH 60 -92 pg and MCHC 0.15 - 0.21. Multiple correlation indices obtained from cage culture fish to determine effects of time (Day), water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (O-2), oxygen saturation level of the water (OSW), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and NH4+ were the following: RBCc was explained by Day and QOSW with coefficient of correlation r = 0.611, Hb was explained by QBOD(5) and QNH(4)(+) with correlation r = 0.783 and MCHC was explained by CODMn, QDay and QO(2) with correlation r = 0.743. Fish from cage culture had significantly greater red blood cell indices (P = 0.01 and P = 0.0000, respectively) than fish from flow-through tanks 651 m above sea level, water temperature 9 +/- 2.5 degreesC and equal nutrition.

Males and females at the top of the ladder showed higher size (weight and length), white muscle fiber diameters, plasma glucose levels and lower hematocrit when compared with those at the bottom. These size and muscle traits assist fish to overcome the ladder barrier and bypass the dam, an effort that might be reflected in the glucose levels. Females also showed higher GSI at the top of the fish ladder, a trait possibly facilitating their reproduction upstream. These results indicate that a dam system favors fish with specific morphological-physiological profile. This may have a strong influence upon upstream fish populations over generations and implies the presence of artificial selective pressure.},

Another decrease in respiration rate took place in Cu group, 3, 4 and 6 days post exposure, and in Cd-intoxicated fish on the 6(th) day, and was probably due to disturbances in aerobic metabolism induced by metals taken up by the organism during exposure. Changes in red blood parameters, at the end of the experiment (Cu group: increase in Hb, MCV and MCH; Cd group: increase in Ht, Hb, and RBC), might have been a compensatory response to damage of erythrocytes induced by both metals.

However, P. lineatus had higher red blood cell counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin, which reflects a considerable adaptation to survive in an environment with low levels of oxygen.},

Fish hematological features, especially the type and number of peripheral blood cells, are crucial for the evaluation of fish health and the diagnosis of fish diseases. Since the automatic blood cell count equipment for human is not suitable for fishes, the manual method is critical in the quantification of fish blood cells. To make sense of the comparison and interpretation of the blood cell count studies in different articles, the standardization of blood cell classification is necessary. In this study, erythrocytes (red blood cell, RBC), thrombocytes (TC) and leucocytes (i.e. white blood cells, WBC, including lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes) were well distinguished in blood smears with Giemsa staining and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. RBC, TC and WBC were directly counted with an improved Neubauer counting chamber in a modified diluting solution. The differential leucocyte count (DLC) was carried out in blood smears. In view of the labeling characteristics of peroxidase (PO) positivity in neutrophils and non-specific esterase (alpha-ANAE) positivity in monocytes, PO positive cell percentage and alpha-ANAE positive cell percentage were also determined in cytochemistry staining smears. No difference was found for the percentages of neutrophils and monocytes between Giemsa staining and cytochemistry staining. The standardized classification, normal count ranges and sizes of the peripheral blood cells by the present systemic studies will provide useful references for monitoring the health status of grass carp, blunt snout bream and yellow catfish.},

For this purpose red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TRIG), cholesterol (CHOL), serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulins (GLO), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined for 30 fish from each species. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in some haematological and biochemical (RBC, Hb, Hct, TP, ALB, GLO, AST, ALT, ALP and LDH) parameters between the two species. Lower values of RBC, Hb and Hct were found in S. salpa in comparison with D. vulgaris. These differences could be attributed to the feeding behavior, life style and habitat adaptation of the different fish species of the same family and contribute to knowledge of reference values of blood parameters in Sarpa salpa and Diplodus vulgaris. No significant differences were found in MCV, MCH, MCHC and GLU, TRIG, CHOL.},

Oxygen levels were measured in both cages at the start of the trial, before the AirX system was introduced, and during the working period of the AirX system. Fish samples were collected 15 days after the AirX system was introduced and at the end of the experiment. Blood smears were prepared and examined microscopically. Erythrocyte major axis, minor axis and area of fish erythrocytes were measured. Leucocyte differentiation was also examined. In the control cage, the fish had significantly larger red blood cells when compared with the red blood cells of the fish in the aerated cage. Histological examination of the gills and brain revealed no morphological differences or alterations between the two groups of fish. This study demonstrated that an air diffuser system could improve the water quality of fish farmed in sea cages and enhance sea bass physiological performance, especially if DO levels fall below 60\% oxygen saturation.},

Different blood biomarkers, including hemato-biochemical indices, erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), and erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA), were observed in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) after exposure to varying sub-lethal concentrations (0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 40\% of 96-h LC50) of profenofos at different time intervals (7, 14, 21, and 28 days). The results revealed that glucose and white blood cell (WBC) levels significantly increased, while hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC), and packed cell volume (PCV) significantly decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Aberrant erythrocytic morphology-derived ENA, such as nuclear degeneration, micronuclear formation, binuclear development, nuclear budding, and karyopyknosis, significantly increased with time in profenofos-exposed groups compared to controls. Between the treatment and control groups, a significant execution was discerned for teardrop and fusion type ECA. For other cellular aberrations of erythrocytes, including elongated, twin, and spindle, a significant difference appeared only at the beginning of the experiment (day 7). This study concludes that the presence of widely used profenofos in aquatic systems has a pernicious effect on Nile tilapia.},

Individual nuclei were examined and measured using scanning electron microscopy and a computerized image analysis system, and inter- and intra-species differences evaluated by nested analysis of variance. Nuclear size and shape varied significantly among species. Isolated nuclei had conspicuous apertures or holes, and the number and size of these holes also varied significantly among species. Variations in nuclear size and structure within species were small compared with interspecies differences. Little is known of the ultrastructure of erythrocyte nuclei in lower vertebrates, but their structure differs considerably from that of other vertebrate non-erythroid cells, suggesting that the organization of their DNA and associated proteins may be different.},

In this work some effects of methyl mercury (MeHg), inorganic lead (Ph2+), and tributyltin (TBT) in a tropical fish species were evaluated by hematological methods after a trophic exposition at a subchronic level. Forty-two mature individuals of the freshwater top predator fish Hoplias malabaricus were exposed to trophic doses (each 5 days) of MeHg (0.075 mu g g(-1)), Pb2+ (21 mu g g(-1)), and TBT (0.3 mu g g(-1)) using young fish Astyanax sp. as prey vehicle. After 14 successive doses over 70 days, blood was sampled from exposed and control groups to evaluate hematological effects of metals on erythrocytes, total leukocytes and differential leukocytes counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell indices mean corpuscular Volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Transmission electron microscopy and image analysis of erythrocytes were also used to investigate some morphometric parameters. Results show no significant effects in MCH and MCHC for all tested metals, but differences were found in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and white blood cells counts. The number of leukocytes was increased in the presence of MeHg, suggesting effects on the immune system. Also the MCV increased in individuals exposed to MeHg. No ultrastructural damages were observed in red blood cells but the image analysis using light microscopy revealed differences in area, elongation, and roundness of erythrocytes from individuals exposed to Pb2+ and TBT but not in the group exposed to MeHg. The present work shows that changes in hematological and blood indices could highlight some barely detectable metal effects in fish after laboratory exposure to contaminated food, but their application in field biomonitoring using H. malabaricus will need more detailed studies and a careful consideration of environmental parameters.

Blood examination results were recorded systematically and reference intervals were established, notably for erythrocyte parameters: hematocrit (Hct) 29-40\%, hemoglobin 8.32-12.28 g/dL, red blood cell (RBC) count 1.01-2.04 (x10(6)/mm(3)); leukocyte parameters (x10(3)/mm(3)): total leukocytes 31.32-90.60, neutrophils 4.21-18.85, total lymphocytes 20.55-63.63, small lymphocytes 14.86-46.50, large lymphocytes 6.35-22.34 and monocytes 1.22-7.56; thrombocyte count 23.00-68.00 (x10(6)/mm(3)). RIs were also established for red blood cell indices, vital serum constituents involved in carbohydrate, protein, lipid and nitrogen metabolism including the less known, diagnostically important, serum enzymes and electrolyte concentrations. Principal component analysis revealed that certain serum components were more efficient at distinguishing between the life stages (juvenile, adult) of fish by explaining about 92.7\% of variation in the whole dataset compared to the principal hematological components which explained only about 80\% of the variation. Significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences were noted for RBC count, total leukocyte count (TLC), total protein, total cholesterol and uric acid with respect to the sex of fish. Moreover, clearly differentiable morphometric and morphological attributes were also noticed among erythrocytes, leukocytes (lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes) and thrombocytes. To our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind that elucidates blood chemistry of cultured rainbow trout, O. mykiss in accordance to the guidelines framed by the American society of veterinary clinical pathologists (ASVCP). RIs reported here can help monitor the fish health status by improving the use of non-lethal diagnostics in piscine medicine. (C) Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.},

	abstract = {Phenol, an aromatic chemical commonly found in domestic and industrial effluents, upon its introduction into aquatic ecosystems adversely affects the indigenous biota, the invertebrates and the vertebrates. With the increased demand for agrochemicals, a large amount of phenol is released directly into the environment as a byproduct. Phenol and its derivatives tend to persist in the environment for longer periods which in turn poses a threat to both humans and the aquatic ecosystem. In our current study, the response of Labeo rohita to sublethal concentrations of phenol was observed and the results did show a regular decrease in biochemical constituents of the targeted organs. Exposure of Labeo rohita to sublethal concentration of phenol (22.32 mg/L) for an epoch of 7, 21 and 28 days shows a decline in lipid, protein, carbohydrate content and phosphatase activity in target organs such as the gills, muscle, intestine, liver and kidney of the fish. The present study also aims to investigate the toxic effects of phenol with special reference to the haematological parameters of Labeo rohita. At the end of the exposure period, the blood of the fish was collected by cutting the caudal peduncle with a surgical scalpel. And it was observed that the red blood corpuscle count (RBC), white blood corpuscle (WBC), haemoglobin count (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values showed a decline after exposure to phenol for 7 days, while white blood corpuscle (WBC) shows an increased count. At 21 days and 28 days, all the haematological parameters showed a significant decrease.},

The Iranian fish showed lower RBC and WBC values than the other cichlids (Oreochromis niloticus, O. aureus, O. mossambicus, O. hybrid, Cichlasoma dimerus and Cichla monoculus). Hematocrit did not vary among the species, but MCV, MCH and MCHC in I. hormuzensis were higher than those for O. niloticus, O. aureus, O. hybrid, C. dimerus and C. monoculus. These differences may be related to different life habit of fish. This study suggests that I. hormuzensis is well acclimated to the environment being the first report for its hematology. It is also suggested high efficiency in oxygen transportation, and an efficient inflow of oxygen by the gills, indicating the welfare of fish on this environment.},

The rate coefficient for unidirectional Cl- efflux via the anion exchanger (k, s(-1)) increased with temperature in African lungfish, but values were well below those reported in other species. The erythrocytes of African lungfish were, however, very large (mean cellular volume 6940 mum(3)), and the ratio of cell water volume to membrane surface area was high (V(w)A(m)(-1) = 1.89). Hence, the apparent Cl- permeability (P-Cl = kV(w)A(m)(-1), mum s(-1)) was close to that in other vertebrates. The plot of InPCl against the inverse absolute temperature was left-shifted in the tropical African lungfish compared to the temperate rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, which supports the idea that P-Cl is similar among animals when compared at their preferred temperatures. Also, Q(10) for anion exchange calculated from P-Cl values in African lungfish was 2.0, supporting the idea that the temperature sensitivity of erythrocyte anion exchange matches the temperature sensitivity of CO2 production and transport in ectothermic vertebrates.

SMR and MMR scaled with body mass with similar exponents, but neither exponent matched the expected value of 0.75 or 1, respectively. Erythrocyte size scaled with body mass with a very low exponent (0.090), suggests that while both cell number and cell size contribute to the increase in body mass, cell size plays a smaller role. The similar slopes of MMR and SMR in grass carp suggest a constant factorial aerobic scope (FAS) as the body grows. SMR was negatively correlated with FAS, indicating a tradeoff between SMR and FAS. Smaller fish recovered faster from the exhaustive exercises, and the scaling exponent of EPOC was 1.075, suggesting a nearly isometric increase in anaerobic capacity. Our results provide support for the cell size model and suggest that variations of erythrocyte size may partly contribute to the intraspecific scaling of SMR. The scaling exponent of MMR was 0.863, suggesting that the metabolism of non-athletic fish species is less reliant on muscular energy expenditure, even during strenuous exercise.},

	abstract = {Blood analysis is a very important and powerful diagnostic tool in animal health and welfare control. It is routinely performed in higher vertebrates, for which reference values are well established, but fish hematology still needs further research. Many intrinsic and environmental factors have profound impact on fish hematological values, making determination of reference values difficult. Additionally, fish blood usually requires the addition of an anticoagulant agent, because of short clotting times. The choice of anticoagulant is vital for obtaining reliable blood test values. In the present study, the impact of two common anticoagulants, K(2)EDTA (1.8 mg/ml) and lithium heparin (18 I.U./ml), on hematological values of farmed brown trout Salmo trutta spawners during the spawning season was investigated. Results of basic hematological analysis, such as packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and white blood cell count (WBC), were compared between these two compounds. Statistically significant differences were observed in PCV, MCV, and MCHC, whereas HGB, RBC, MCH, and WBC showed no such differences. These results suggest that lithium heparin gives more reliable results, because red blood cells in K(2)EDTA-treated samples have a tendency to swell. It is worth noting that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid salt did not induce sample hemolysis in the present study.},

There was a preponderance of zooplankton, accounting for {\textgreater} 80\% occurrence and {\textgreater} 25\% of total volume in the stomachs of specimens from all habitats; this suggests a microphagous habit. Digestive enzyme assays in the different gut regions (oesophagus, stomach, pyloric caeca, ileum, rectum) of H. niloticus revealed an array of glycosidases (amylase, sucrase, maltase, lactase, cellulase); proteases (pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin) and lipases were also detected. The pattern of distribution and relative activity of the enzymes is consistent with its planktophagous diet. Haematocrit values, haemoglobin concentrations, erythrocyte and leucocyte counts, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, plasma protein, glucose and albumin, inorganic ion (sodium, chloride, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) concentrations of pond-cultured H. niloticus were established.

Apoptosis, erythrocytes alterations, micronucleus test and blood parameters count were used as biological indicators to detect those effects. After exposure to sublethal concentrations of 4-nonylphenol (0, 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1 mg/l), apoptotic red blood cells with many malformations and micronucleated erythrocytes were recorded. Decrease in the blood parameters such as red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), package cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets, white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes and increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), neutrophils, eosinophils indicated the negative effects of 4-nonylphenol. It was concluded that, the 4-nonylphenol caused genotoxicity in erythrocytes with many malformations in shape and number indicated with other blood parameters. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, a field study was conducted to investigate the hematological parameters of wild population of rohu, Labeo rohita (Ham).

For this purpose, rohu fish of varying sizes and weights were sampled from Hebbal (receiving a storm water drain) and Chowkalli lake (received domestic sewage and industrial effluents from various sources and was more polluted than Hebbal lake). It revealed noticeable differences in hemoglobin content, RBC and WBC count, and PCV and MCHC values. Severe anemia can be marked by a significant decrease in RBC count (p {\textless} 0.5), hemoglobin content, and PCV and MCHC values, whereas an increase in leukocyte count and MCV values were observed in fish from Chowkalli lake. Fish from lake B had fewer RBC and low concentration of serum protein and cholesterol. Serum concentration of glucose showed initial higher levels and then low concentration (900-1,500 g) in fish from lake B when compared to lake A. The variation in values of different parameters can be attributed to exposure of fish to various types of pollutants present mainly in the Chowkalli lake which receives heavy metals, synthetic detergents, petroleum products, and other acid and alkali substances from the nearby local industries. Other observations of these fish include dark body color and aggressive nature of fish.},

Effluxes of Na+ and Cl- were lower in hypoxia than in normoxia for S. eigenmanni, possibly because in hypoxia this species would reduce gill ventilation and oxygen uptake, which would lead to a decrease of gill ion efflux and, consequently, reducing ion loss. The increase on hematocrit (Ht) during hypoxia in M. hypsauchen probably was caused by an increase of the red blood cell volume (MCV). For S. eigenmanni the increase on glucose possibly results from the usage of glucose reserve mobilization. Metynnis hypsauchen showed to be more sensitive to hypoxia than Serrasalmus eigenmanni, since the first presented more significant alterations on these osmoregulatory and hematological parameters. Nevertheless, the alterations observed for both species are strategies adopted by fishes to preserve oxygen supply to metabolizing tissues during exposure to hypoxia.},

The results showed that triploidy increased (p {\textless} 0.01) the size and volume of the erythrocytes. Nevertheless, as expected, triploidy decreased (p {\textless} 0.01) the number of circulating erythrocytes, leucocytes and trombocytes in the blood of jundia. Moreover differential cell counts were different in diploids and triploids, suggesting that triploidy affects the number of cells and their proportion in blood. Lymphocytes were the most predominant cells in the differential counting of diploid fish (62.5\%) while monocytes were predominant in triploid fish (49.6\%).

Morphometric indices of erythrocytes were determined on blood smears by light microscopy. Triploidy significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) increased all morphometric indices measured in the erythrocytes including cell size, cell surface area, and cell volume. The increase in cell size was larger for the major (27\%) axis than for the minor (22\%) axis, thus making erythrocytes of 3n Caspian salmon more ellipsoidal. The estimated increase in erythrocyte nuclear volume (87\%) was bigger than the theoretical expected 50\% increase. Haematological indices were measured manually by hemocytometry. Triploids had lower numbers of red blood cells (RBC: 1,120,000 cells/ mL in 2n vs. 700,000 cells/ mL in 3n; P {\textless} 0.001) but they were larger in size ( mean erythrocytic volume [MEV]: 363.1 nm(3) in 2n vs. 483.3 nm(3) in 3n; P {\textless} 0.001).

A comparative hematological evaluation was made to assess the effects of environmental conditions on the blood of the fish. Ten individuals of each species were collected from a seagrass bed at Libong Island, where human activities are increasing, and from a secluded sandy beach. Their blood samples were analysed using the blood smear technique. Erythrocytes of all the studied fishes were either elliptical or oval. The morphometric data from both locations showed that erythrocytes were of similar size, except for those of Zanarchopterus sp. Fish from both stations showed several types of leukocytes, including neutrophils and lymphocytes.The highest proportion of leukocytes was made up of lymphocytes, followed by neutrophils. However, monocytes were only observed in fish from Libong Island and the erythrocytic nuclei of fish collected from Libong Island were both reniform and lobate.

	abstract = {The insecticide cypermethrin adversely affects biochemical parameters in blood and behavior in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were obtained from the hatchery and reared in the laboratory. Different concentrations of cypermethrin were applied. Blood was collected and hematological and biochemical para-meters were measured. Biochemical parameters such as protein levels, cholesterol, phosphorous and calcium in both acute and chronically cypermethrin-treated groups decreased, with increasing exposure time from 24h to 15 days with more pronounced effects in the acute groups. Increased glucose, urea, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were found in both acute and chronic groups with increasing exposure time. Hematological parameters, such as red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MHCH), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were significantly reduced in both groups as the exposure time increases. However, the number of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets increased. This study established both the acute and chronic toxicity of cypermethrin in grass carp, which likely occurs secondary to altered biochemical and blood parameters.},

Haematological and biochemical parameters were investigated in 80 cultured striped bass Morone saxatilis, in order to evaluate a possible correlation between biometric indices (weight and total length) and blood parameters in this species of fish. For this purpose, blood samples were collected from each fish to evaluate the haematological profile (white blood cells, WBC; red blood cell, RBC; haemoglobin concentration, Hb; haematocrit, Hct; mean corpuscular volume, MCV; mean corpuscular haemoglobin, MCH; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, MCHC; thrombocytes, TC), and some biochemical parameters (glucose, GLU; serum total protein, TP; total cholesterol, CHOL and triglycerides, TRIG). The obtained results showed a statistically significant positive relationship between the weight of fish and RBC and TRIG. All the other studied parameters showed no correlation with the biometric indices. This study evaluates the possible correlation between biometric indices (weight and total length) and blood parameters, representing a valid contribution to the knowledge of the blood parameters of Striped bass and could be used as reference for a comparison in further studies to evaluate the health status of this species of fish in different cultured system, because assessment of these parameters may be used as quick tool for health status, stress and poor aquaculture management.},

Results showed significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences in hematological parameters of the two species. Significantly higher hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (RBC) and hematocrit (Hct) values were recorded in S. plagiostomus as compared to S. niger. Conversely, the values of thrombocyte count (TC), white blood cell count (WBC) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were higher in S. niger in comparison to S. plagiostomus. The erythrocyte dimensions of these two species were distinguished and characterized under light microscopy; different morphometric characteristics were observed, such as larger size and smaller number in S. niger as compared to S. plagiostomus. The variation in hematological parameters and morphometric characteristics of erythrocytes between the two species inhabiting different environments might be due to their divergent physiological activity level, movement, metabolic rate and feeding behavior. This study will provide essential tools for physiologists and pathologists in monitoring the health status of these fish species in particular and fish species in general.},

Alterations in erythrocytes and differential leucocytic count, and changes in total red blood cells (ABCs), white blood cells (WBCs) content, haemoglobin (Hb), percentage lymphocyte (\%LYM), packed cell volume (PCV), thrombocytes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were used to detect those responses. The choline-fed fishes depicted significant responses like lymphocytosis and neutrophilia; increased number of RBCs, Hb, PCV, MCHC, WBCs, \%LYM, monocytes (Mo), neutrophils (Ne), thrombocytes (Th); and decreased number of eosinophils (Eo), MCV, and MCH. In non-choline-fed fishes, analysis revealed the abnormal morphology of erythrocytes due to poor erythropoiesis, e.g., hypochromic, as well as haemorrhagic anaemia with hypoxia, and thrombocytopenia. This study intended to establish the influence of direct choline supplementation on haematopoietic alterations, which can serve as an indicator to improve the defence mechanism as marked by the increased quantity of thrombocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. It can be inferred that this culture practice is able to produce the disease-resistant fish species which can bring about a better yield to avoid an economic loss to the poor fish farmers.},

	abstract = {We examined intraspecific scaling of the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) under different culture conditions and further explored the allometric relationships between organ mass (heart, liver, brain, gills, viscera, and red muscles) and blood parameters (erythrocyte size and red blood cell counts) and body mass. Oreochromis niloticus were bred in individual and group cultures. The scaling exponent of the RMR in the individual cultures was b = 0.620-0.821 (n = 30) and that in the group culture was b = 0.770 [natural logarithm (ln) RMR = 0.770 ln M - 1.107 (n = 76)]. The results of the two experimental methods were similar and were not significantly different from 0.75 (3/4), as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology. The active and inactive organs were scaled with body mass by an exponent of 0.940 and 1.012, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the blood parameters and body mass. These results suggest that the differences in the culture methods may not have affected the allometric scaling of O. niloticus metabolism. The proportion of active and inactive organs contributed to allometric changes in the metabolic rate with body mass. Red blood cells in fish are not generally representative, and cell size can only partially explain the allometric scaling of metabolism.},

The median lethal concentration of lindane for 24 h was 0.38 ppm. During acute treatment (24 h), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and erythrocyte (RBC) values were decreased, whereas leucocyte (WBC) count increased in the pesticide treated fish. The hematological indices like mean cellular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were decreased when compared to control group. Biochemical profiles like plasma glucose and protein levels were increased in lindane exposed fish showing a percent increase of 50.36 and 3.98 at the end of 24 h treatment. However, glycogen content in liver and muscle were decreased showing a percent decrease of 21.70 and 1.74. In sublethal treatment (1/10th of LC50 24h value, 0.038 ppm), RBC count was decreased whereas WBC count increased in the pesticide treated fish throughout the study period (25 days). Hb and Hct values were decreased up to 10th day and after that recovered showing a significant increase in the rest of the study period. Similarly, a biphasic response was observed in the value of MCV, MCH and MCHC. Plasma glucose level was significantly increased while plasma protein level decreased throughout the study period. Further, glycogen level in muscle and liver were showed a mixed trend. In the present study, the pesticide lindane caused alterations on haematological and biochemical parameters of C. carpio and these alterations can be used as non specific biomarkers in pesticide contaminated aquatic ecosystem.

The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio two times lower compared to teleosts, the volume of cells two times higher and their specific surface area 1.5 times larger, the more pronounced ellipsoidal shape of mature erythrocytes, and the high concentration of hemoglobin indicate that erythrocytes of P. senegalus have a significant potential for gas exchange between the external and internal environment, which is more characteristic of amphibians (Amphibia). The revealed features of erythropoiesis of the mesonephros and peripheral blood of P. senegalus are markers of adaptation to air respiration and periodic terrestrial migrations.

This study aims to examine the effect of temperature on metabolic scaling and to verify the links between metabolic scaling and surface area scaling at both the whole body and the cell levels. The routine metabolic rate (RMR), gill surface area (GSA), ventilation frequency (VF), red blood cell surface area (S-RBC), and metabolic rate (MRRBC) were determined in silver carp, and their mass-scaling exponents were analyzed at 10 and 25 degrees C. These results showed that body mass and temperature independently affected the RMR, GSA, and VF, suggesting constant scaling exponents of RMR (0.772), GSA (0.912), and VF (-0.282) with changing temperature. The RMR at 25 degrees C was 2.29 times higher than that at 10 degrees C, suggesting increased metabolic demand at a higher temperature. The results showed that the RMR increased, while the scaling exponents of RMR, GSA, and VF remained unchanged with increasing temperature. These results support the view that the scaling of oxygen supply capacity importantly affects metabolic scaling. The S-RBC did not change with either temperature or body mass. However, the MRRBC increased by 5.48 times from 10 to 25 degrees C but did not change with body mass. As the scaling exponents of RMR did not change between temperatures, the results indicate that no obvious link exists between the scaling of both the cell size and cell metabolic rate and the metabolic scaling of silver carp.},

Aquatic animals often overcome this condition with a combination of physiological, behavioural, biochemical and molecular responses. In the present study, we examined the effect of moderate hypoxia on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and oxygen transport mechanism in Delminichthys ghetaldii erythrocytes. Popovo minnow ( Delminichthys ghetaldii ) is an endemic cyprinid fish which inhabits springs and streams in fields Ljubomir, Dabar and Fatnica in B\&H, and Bacina lakes in Croatia. During autumn and spring floods, Popovo minnows emerge from the underground waters to surface estavelle. Withdrawal of the water to the underground basins brings them back to their underground habitat. Fishes were collected in the flood plain of Fatnica field (43 degrees 00 ' 53 ” N; 18 degrees 19 ' 24 ” E). Following erythrocyte lineage parameters were measured: number of red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin concentration, Packed cell volume (PCV), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) and MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin). Also, the characterization of the SOD from RBC is presented for the first time. Native PAGE resolved the presence of three CuZn SOD isoforms, while isoelectrofocusing revealed the presence of two anionic SOD isoforms with pI 3.4 and 3.5. Exposure to conditions of mild hypoxia induced changes in fish SOD activity, hemoglobin concentration and MCH. Results indicate Delminichthys ghetaldii responds to hypoxia by enhancement of the oxygen carrying capacity and triggering SOD activity.},

So the present study was designed to determine the hematological parameters of farm and river Chenab (wild) selected fish species including (Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish species selected for the current study is generally widely cultured in Pakistan and worldwide. Fish sampling was done by using different nets (river and farm) and blood sampling was immediately drawn from caudal peduncle by syringe and added in EDTA containing vial and shake well for proper mixing. Vials stored in ice containing boxes and carried to laboratory for total complete blood count. The water parameter was analyzed in laboratory by taking the sample of water and some (Temperature, DO) was measured in situ. Results of hematological analysis revealed that there is no significant (P 0.05) difference in packed cell volume, mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin of different selected species adapted to similar environmental conditions. However, all other parameters like red blood cells, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, white blood cells, lymphocytes, mid-range cells, granulocytes and other less important parameters including platelets, red cell distribution width-standard deviation, red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation, platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume, Plateletcrit and Platelet-Large cell ratio are differed significantly (P{\textless}0.05). Similar trend was observed in fishes of both selected sites "Farm" and "River. It was concluded that hematological variance can occur between animals of different species and same species of different habitat, but as the water parameter remains the same across the studies so current studies don't show any significant difference.},

	abstract = {The biomonitoring of fish using biomarkers represents a useful tool for the assessment of aquatic pollution. This study evaluated the sublethal toxic effects of aquatic pollution on fish collected from a site contaminated by metals. Water and fish (Oreochromis niloticus) samples were collected from a pond in the Parque Ecologico do Tiete (PET) that lies along the Tiete River (Sao Paulo, Brazil), and from a control site (an experimental fish farm). The metal content of the water was evaluated, and fish were used to examine the properties of gill mucus and blood. The PET fish were evaluated for alterations in the in vitro transportability of mucus and changes in blood properties (e.g., cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, and white blood cell count). The results of the water analyzes indicated metal levels above the legal standards for Fe (0.71 mg/L), Ni (0.06 mg/L), Mn (0.11 mg/L), and Pb (0.48 mg/L). Compared to the controls, the hematologic parameter analyzes of PET fish revealed significantly higher numbers of erythrocytes (RBC), leukocytes (WBC), lymphocytes, erythroblasts, and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV); however, the hemoglobin content and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) values were significantly lower. The frequencies of nuclear abnormalities and micronuclei were significantly higher and the mucociliary transport was significantly lower in PET fish than in the controls. These results suggest that fish from the contaminated site exhibit a series of physiological responses, which probably indicate health disturbances. Furthermore, the results suggest that blood and mucus are promising, non-destructive targets for use in the monitoring of pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Lymphocytes with heavily clumped heterochromatic nucleus and minimal cytoplasm were classified into small and large lymphocytes. Three different populations of granules, with distinctive ultrastructural aspect, were observed in neutrophils. Monocytes were the fewest leucocytes possessing rich organelles, phagocytized materials and vacuoles. Thrombocytes with various types were the most abundant blood cells among leucocytes and contained a prominent nucleus with dense bands of heterochromatin and many cytoplasmic vacuoles. Periodic acid-Schiff staining was positive in neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes, but not in erythrocytes. Peroxidase-positive staining was observed in neutrophils and monocytes, but not in erythrocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes. Only neutrophils were positive for oil red O. Except for erythrocytes, the other blood cells stained positively for acid phosphatase. Only neutrophils and monocytes were positive for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. None of the cells studied were positive for alkaline phosphatase. The morphologic and cytochemical features of blood cells of S. prenanti are similar to those of other fish.

Fish exposed to untreated dye solution showed reduction in RBC, PCV, Hb, MCHC, plasma glucose and plasma protein, increased level of WBC, MCV and MCH and also alteration in AST and ALT thereby indicating the toxicity of the dye. No such reduction and alteration were observed in haematological, biochemical and enzymological levels of fishes exposed to tap water and treated dye solution indicating the non-toxic nature of the degraded metabolites of dye. Histological examination of fishes exposed to methyl orange dye revealed necrosis and haemorrhage in the gills and hepatocytes, congested and shrunken glomeruli in kidney thereby indicating the toxicity of the dye. The histoarchitecture of control and algae-treated fishes showed no structural changes indicating the non-toxic nature of the degraded metabolites of the dye.

Silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) find its uses in various fields and are inevitably released into the environment. However, the ecotoxicological effects of SiO2-NPs on the freshwater fish remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations (1, 5 and 25 mg L-1) of SiO2-NPs on certain hematological, ionoregulatory and enzymological profiles of a freshwater teleost fish Labeo rohita. Hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values were altered in SiO2-NPs treated groups. Likewise, plasma electrolytes such as plasma sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl) levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity in gill of SiO2-NPs treated groups were altered in all concentrations throughout the study period (96 h). The alterations of these parameters were found to be dependent on dose and exposure period. The results of the present study indicate that the alterations of these parameters may relate to physiological stress system to SiO2-NPs toxicity and also demonstrate that manufactured metal oxide NPs in aquatic environment may affect the health condition of the aquatic organisms.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb content (MCH) depended on erythrocyte maturation. Blood sampling in late spring guaranteed maximum proportions of immRBC.},

After 240 days when morphological changes and an increased mortality also appeared, the changes in RBC [red blood cell] and related values (Hb, hematocrit, MCV [mean cell volume], MCH [mean corpuscular Hb] and MCHC [mean corpuscular Hb concentration]) were highly significant and indicated hypochromic microcytic anemia; this was accompanied by leukopenia. The hematopoietic studies revealed significant increase in the earlier stages of erythrocytic development (basophilic erythroblasts and polychromatophilic erythroblasts) with a simultaneous decrease in the later stages (young and mature reticulocytes). A series of pathological disorders in the various developing cells were recorded in the imprints of hematopoietic tissues. The pyridoxine specificity of these changes were confirmed by remedial treatment for a month.},

For this purpose, 80 M. cephalus (20 for each season) were captured in three different stations of Faro Lake, Messina, Sicily. Biometric indices (weight, fork length, and total length) of each fish were registered. The physico-chemical parameters of the water of the study area were also measured, and the content of trace elements in water and sediment was determined. The hematological (white blood cell, WBC; red blood cell, RBC; hemoglobin concentration, Hb; hematocrit, Hct; mean corpuscular volume, MCV; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, MCHC; thrombocytes count, TC), biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; alkaline phosphatase, ALP; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and the seasonal concentration of the trace elements in the different tissues of M. cephalus were assessed. Our results showed a different biodistribution of the trace elements in M. cephalus and significant variations of the blood parameters in the different seasons. This research provides a valid contribute to environmental biomonitoring techniques useful in aquatic pollution control and water management. It also contributes to broadening the studies on the improvement of the health and sustainability of aquatic environments.},

Salmonid fish are of great importance in aquaculture; however, hematological studies of these species are scarce. This study presents the first set of data for the complete hematological profile of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmonidae). In total, seven blood cell types were identified and their characterization, range, size/surface area, and the leukocyte differential count are presented. Large numbers of immature erythrocytes and two subtypes of thrombocytes (round and prolate) were present in blood. Lymphocytes were the dominant leukocytes, followed by segmented neutrophils. Total leukocyte and segmented neutrophil counts were higher in the blood of male than female fish (P {\textless} 0.05). Here we describe, for the first time, basophilic cells in salmonid fish species. Blood cell types present in brook trout were similar to mammalian blood cells, but their morphology, number, size, and subtypes were unique to this fish species. The established reference model indicates differences in comparison with the cyprinid fish. The hematological profile described in this study will serve as an important model for examining comparative physiology of blood cells in other salmonid fish and will provide useful diagnostic criteria in aquaculture for the detection and mitigation of different pathological outcomes.},

MCV was higher in larger fish, whereas the reverse trend was found for MCHC. Decreased levels of plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride in the pre-spawning period, when female ovaries were developing, may have been due to the combination of reproductive effects and food shortage in winter. Total protein levels were lower during the maturing period than during the pre-spawning period.

In this study, parameters of erythrocyte lineage of Delminichthys ghetaldii (Steindachner 1882), an endemic species inhabiting the karst waters of eastern Herzegovina, were investigated. Fish were caught by nets in the region of Fatnicko polje (Fatnica field) after the water outflow in March 2013, blood was taken by heart puncture and erythrocyte parameters were determined. Their mean values were as follows: the number of erythrocyte (RBC) = 1.474 x 10(12)/l; hemoglobin concentration (Hb) = 72.50 g/l; packed cell volume (PCV) = 0.398 l/l; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) = 271.19 fl; mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) = 49.36 pg, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) = 193.16 g/l eryt. Body mass and morphometric features were also estimated and their mean values were: body mass = 25.49 g, total and standard body length = 14.13 cm and 11.98 cm, respectively, Fulton coefficient = 1.45. For the values of all parameters, the normality of distribution was tested, as well as differences between mean values of males and females. Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analyses between mass, morphometric and hematological parameters have shown that erythrocyte parameters may influence body mass and of morphometric characteristics in this species.},

Treatment was continued for 14 d and samples of the blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) were collected at the end of the experiment and analysed for their oxidant-antioxidant status, including the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. The samples were also measured for changes in the haematological parameters, such as the red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, the haemoglobin concentration (Hb), the haematocrit (Ht) level, and the erythrocyte indices: the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The findings of this study demonstrated that CPF had a negative effect on the haematological parameters and the antioxidant enzyme activities of the fish; this toxic effect was neutralised by the administration of lycopene. The present results suggest that lycopene (10 mg kg(-1)) can be effective in the protection of CPF-induced toxicity in fish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When fish live in the wild or are cultured artificially, they will inevitably suffer from hypoxia. At the same time, blood physiological indexes represent the physiological state of fish. In order to study the effect of long-term hypoxia acclimation on fish hematogenesis, we cultured zebrafish embryos into adulthood in a hypoxia incubator (1.5 +/- 0.2 mg/L). Then we compared the hematological parameters of zebrafish cultured in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of the main hematopoietic tissue, the head kidney, was also compared between the two groups. Results showed that the number of erythrocytes increased significantly in the long-term hypoxia acclimated group, while the size of several cell types, such as red blood cells, eosinophils, basophils, small lymphocytes and thrombocytes, decreased significantly. The transcriptomic comparisons revealed that there were 6475 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that hematopoiesis and cell proliferation signaling were the most significantly enriched pathways in the head kidney of hypoxia acclimated zebrafish. In addition, many genes involved in the hematopoietic process showed significantly higher levels of expression in the hypoxia acclimated zebrafish, when compared to the normoxia zebrafish. When considered together, these data allowed us to conclude that long-term hypoxia can promote the hematopoiesis process and cell proliferation signaling in the zebrafish head kidney, which resulted in higher red blood cell production. Higher numbers of red blood cells allow for better adaptation to the hypoxic environment. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for the in-depth understanding of the effects of hypoxia on hematogenesis in fish species.},

At three concentrations, packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin, Red blood cells (RBC) Hb, T3, T4, and total protein were significantly decreased in fish treated with CPF, whereas the parameters White blood cells (WBC), creatinine, Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (GPT) presented a significant increase at the two higher concentrations. However, the sub-chronic exposure to CPF resulted in histological lesions and caused clear damage to liver, muscles, and gill tissues of the fish Cyprinus carpio. Thus, we may conclude that the altered biochemical and hematological parameters can be used as efficient biomarkers in monitoring the toxicity of CPF in aquatic organisms.

Cytogenetic data and confocal microscopy were also used attempting to confirm relationships between DNA content and cytological parameters. The haploid genome size was 0.71 +/- 0.03 pg for Sphoeroides greeleyi, 0.34 +/- 0.01 pg for Sphoeroides spengleri, 0.82 +/- 0.03 pg for Sphoeroides testudineus (all Tetraodontidae), and 1.00 +/- 0.03 pg for Chilomycterus spinosus (Diodontidae). These differences are not related with ploidy level, because 46 chromosomes are considered basal for both families. The value for S. spengleri represents the smallest vertebrate genome reported to date. Since erythrocyte cell and nuclear sizes are strongly correlated with genome size, the variation in this last is considered under both adaptive and evolutionary perspectives.},

Subsequent stress responses were quantified by plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate, and by the haematological parameters haematocrit (Hct), red blood cell count (RBCC), mean cell volume (MCV), blood haemoglobin concentration (Hb), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total protein and erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The magnitude of stress responses was similar between diploid and triploid smolts. Triploid smolts displayed a higher MCH, but lower Hb than diploid smolts. The blood oxygen affinity of diploid and triploid fish was similar at 15 degrees C over the pH range 6.76-7.99 and the isohaemoglobin components were identical. The enlarged triploid erythrocytes showed reduced shear-dependence on blood viscosity at constant Hct and are therefore unlikely to contribute to greater peripheral vascular resistance. The results show that despite having fewer, larger erythrocytes, triploids have very similar oxygen carrying capacity and haematological response to stress as diploids. This suggests that the higher farm mortality reported for triploids in response to stress is not generated by their failure to show respiratory homeostasis in the face of stress.

	abstract = {Background. Biomarker indices (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, mineral, enzymatic, and antioxidant enzymes) are used for the evaluation of health in fish blood. No studies conducted to date have provided standard values of various biomarkers in the blood plasma of Hucho hucho (Linnaeus, 1758). Therefore, we evaluated the physiological status and seasonal variation in metabolic profiles of this species. Significant seasonal changes were observed in all blood biomarkers, with the exception of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Using these data, the physiological status and seasonal variation in the metabolic profiles of H. hucho were evaluated. Generally, the goal of this study was to characterize the variation in the blood biomarkers of huchen between different seasons. Materials and methods. Fish were raised in captivity to obtain a breeding group to repopulate submontane rivers. Blood samples were collected by puncture of the caudal vein in a vacutainer with Li-Heparin to determine the seasonal values of hematological, biochemical parameters, and oxidative stress. Blood was collected from a random sample of 10 huchen in all four seasons. Results. We found significant seasonal variation in several parameters: packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), gamma-globulins (GG), urea (UREA), creatinine (CRN), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), glucose (GLC), calcium (Ca2+), phosphorus (PO43-), iron (Fe3+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl aminotransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), alpha-Amylase (alpha-Amy), lipase (LIP), total bilirubin (TB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Conclusion. This is the first study to provide standard values of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and minerals and the enzyme profile in huchen in all seasons, which may be a benchmark for future investigation that would favor the bioconservation and increase the spread of huchen.},

Fish are highly sensitive to slight environmental alterations, their physiological and biochemical alterations reveal the health status of organism and its surroundings. Fish biomarkers such as hematology, biochemical, and antioxidants in blood and organ were routinely analysed to assess the health condition of the fish. In the present study an Indian major carp, Cirrhinus mrigala was exposed to two different (1 and 10 mg/L) concentrations of SMTZ for 28 days. Hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), red blood cells (RBCs), and white blood cells (WBCs) were found to be altered in SMTZ exposed fish when compared to control groups in both the concentrations. Likewise, significant (p {\textless} 0.05) alterations in erythrocyte indices such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were found to be altered in SMTZ exposed fish. Biochemical parameters such as glucose and protein, and antioxidant status of super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxides (GPx), and lipid peroxides (LPO) levels were also found to be altered in fingerlings exposed to SMTZ in both 1 and 10 mg/L concentration when compared to their respective control groups. The data of the present study indicates that SMTZ is mild toxic to fingerlings at environmental relevant concentration. The interaction of SMTZ or its metabolites may be responsible for the observed alterations in the studied parameters. However, more data on combined effect of SMTZ with other antibiotics on other cultivable fish are urgently needed.},

The following annual averages were obtained for the hematological parameters: hematocrit ratio (Hct), females 38.0 +/- 0.32\%, males 37.3 +/- 0.36\%; hemoglobin level (Hb), females 12.8 +/- 0.13 g/100 mL, males 13.0 +/- 0.16 g/100 mL; erythrocyte (RBC) count, females 1050263.4 +/- 5857.20 mm(3), males 1046081.13 +/- 6319.89 mm(3); leukocyte (WBC) count, females 15797.4 +/- 259.11 mm(3), males 16545.0 +/- 354.54 mm(3); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), females 363.2 +/- 3.12 mu m(3), males 358.8 +/- 3.57 mu m(3); mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), females 123.0 +/- 1.16 pg, males 124.3 +/- 1.48 pg; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), females 33.7 +/- 0.17 g/100 mL, males 34.8 +/- 0.22 g/100 mL. Hematological parameters differed significantly (P{\textless}0.05) between reproduction periods and between seasons. For both, male and female horse mackerel, the Hct, Hb, RBC, WBC, MCV, and MCH values increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05) with size and age. The WBC increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05) with increasing sea water temperature in both sexes. In this study, the reference values of hematological parameters were obtained and it was concluded that these parameters were affected by physiological (fish size, age, reproduction) and environmental (season, temperature) factors. Such factors as well as the reference values should be taken into consideration when hematologic studies for horse mackerel is to be conducted.},

After blood collection (T-0), all samples were analyzed using both the manual and automatic method. To test the validation of the automatic method, a paired t-test was applied, and no statistical difference was observed. The samples were successively divided into four different aliquots and stored at +4 degrees C to assess the haematological parameters using the automatic method. The first aliquot was refrigerated for 6 h, the second one for 24 h, the third one for 48 h and the last one at for 72 h. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of storage time (P{\textless}0.05) on Hb, WBC, TC, MCH and MCHC. These results suggest that haematological parameters can be assessed within 6 h from blood collection when samples are stored at +4 degrees C because long-term storage modifies the results of the analyses. Further studies on these parameters could be still needed in various fish species to validate an appropriate method for haematological analysis useful not only for the evaluation of the health status of animal living in captivity and in aquaculture but also to have reliability environmental haematological biomarkers.

	abstract = {Concern on the toxicity of final wastewater generated by the petroleum refining industry has increased in recent years due to the potential health threats associated with their release into the waterways. This study determined the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of petroleum refinery wastewater and a receiving river using the Ames fluctuation test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98, SOS chromotest on Escherichia coli PQ37, and piscine peripheral micronucleus (MN) assay. Analyses of the physicochemical parameters, heavy metal, and organic contents of the samples were also performed. Ames test result showed that the two tested samples were mutagenic with TA100 strain as the more responsive strain for both the refinery wastewater and the river sample in terms of the calculated mutagenic index. A similar result was obtained in the SOS chromotest; however, the E. coli PQ37 system recorded a slightly higher sensitivity for detecting genotoxins than the Salmonella assay in the two samples. MN data showed induction of a concentration-dependent significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in the frequency of MN by both samples when compared with the negative control. Generally, the refinery wastewater induced the highest mutagenicity and genotoxicity compared to the river sample in the three assays used. Haemoglobin, platelets, red blood cells, mean corpuscular volume, total white blood cells, heterophils, haematocrit, and eosinophils reduced significantly with increased lymphocytes, basophils, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration in fishes exposed to both samples. Total petroleum hydrocarbon, benzene, toluene, phenol index, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, mercury, nickel, lead, and vanadium contents analysed in the samples were believed to be responsible for the observed genotoxicity and mutagenicity. The findings of this study revealed that petroleum refinery wastewater is a potential mutagenic and genotoxic risk to the environment.},

Forty-eight healthy 3-year-old G.eckloni (26 males: 525.79 +/- 48.56g weight, 34.51 +/- 1.88cm total length; 22 females: 507.60 +/- 54.48g weight, 33.97 +/- 1.84cm total length) were used for this study. Both male and female gonadal maturity were at stage III (maturing). The fish were reared in 25-36m(2) outdoor tanks at dissolved oxygen 6.86 +/- 0.48mgL(-1), pH 7.22 +/- 0.58, temperature 12.40 +/- 0.94 degrees C and stocking density 50-80 fishm(-3) during November 2014. The fish were fed commercial carp floating foods containing 35\% crude protein three times daily. Haematological values were performed manually on heparin anticoagulated blood specimens using standard methods. The morphological features of blood cells and differential cell counts were done on Wright-Giemsa stained blood smears with no anticoagulants. Erythrocytes, leucocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) and thrombocytes were distinguished and characterized under light microscope. The percentage of the different leukocytes revealed predominance of small lymphocytes (male: 62.31 +/- 2.06\%; female: 63.00 +/- 2.25\%) and nurophiles (male: 23.85 +/- 1.51\%; female: 23.49 +/- 1.67\%) followed by fewer monocytes (male: 4.81 +/- 0.68\%; female: 4.80 +/- 0.77\%) and few eosinophils (male: 3.73 +/- 0.82\%; female: 3.52 +/- 0.67\%). The nurophile percentages of each stage showed that metamyelocyte accounted for the most (male: 13.29 +/- 0.88\%; female: 13.07 +/- 0.98\%), followed by banded ones (male: 7.18 +/- 0.49\%; female: 7.00 +/- 0.58\%). The microstructure of G.eckloni blood cells was similar to that of other fish. Sex-dependent differences for the erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin, haematocrit and mean corpuscular haemoglobin were found (P{\textless}0.05 or P{\textless}0.01); while differences in other haematological parameters (P{\textgreater}0.05) and blood cell morphology between male and female fish were not significant. Hematologic parameters and knowledge of morphological characteristics of male and female G.eckloni blood cells could be utilized to evaluate the health status of this species in captivity.},

	abstract = {The present study sought to investigate the effects of Astragalus membranaceus root (AMR) and A. membranaceus leaves (AML) on the growth performance, immune and antioxidant response, and disease resistance of Amur minnow (Phoxinus lagowskii). Here, we compared the health-promoting effects of AMR-and AML-supplemented diets on P. lagowskii and assessed whether the AML could be used as a candidate dietary supplement to promote fish health. After 8 weeks of feeding, the AM-supplemented groups exhibited higher growth performance, especially the AMR 0.5\% and AML 1.0\% groups. Hematological parameters including white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and mean cell volume (MCV) were significantly increased in fish fed supplementation with AM-containing diets compared to the basal diet, and the WBC was highest in the AML 1.0\% group. The highest serum lysozyme level was found in fish fed with a diet containing 0.5\% AMR. The results of lysozyme (LZM), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) indicated that AM supplementation had no adverse effects on P. lagowskii. The liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased in the AMR1.5\% group, whereas catalase (CAT) activity significantly increased in all AMR and AML groups compared to the control group. Moreover, the villus height was significantly increased in the AMR 0.5\% and AML 1.0\% groups. After the feeding trial, the fish supplemented with 0.5\% AMR exhibited the highest tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), and Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expression levels in the muscle. Furthermore, both AMR and AML dietary supplementation enhanced the resistance of P. lagowskii against Aeromonas hydrophila except in the AML 0.5\% group. The mortality rate of fish infected with Acinetobacter tjernbergiae after AMR or AML treatment was 40\% to 70\%, and the survival rate of the AML 1.0\% group was the highest (60\%). Therefore, additional studies are needed to further evaluate the applicability of Chinese herbal medicine supplementation for the prevention of diseases caused by Acinetobacter. Collectively, our analyses of hematological parameters of WBC, villus height changes, and survival rates of bacteria-infected individuals indicated that the dietary addition of AML 1.0\% is an optimal dose for P. lagowskii.},

	abstract = {Bifenthrin is a (type I; III generation; non-cyano) synthetic pyrethroid used for both agricultural and non-agricultural purposes. Due to its common use, it is widely reported from different parts of the world. Its use is on a continuous rise, which poses a significant risk to non-target organisms including fish. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to assess multiple biomarkers-based toxicological endpoints of bifenthrin-exposed Ctenopharyngodon idella, grass carp. The first part of the research evaluated the LC50 of bifenthrin against grass carp for 96 h, followed by investigating its effect on their biochemical profile [total protein; antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-s-transferase (GST); serum biochemical parameters including chloride, magnesium, sodium, potassium, albumin, total bilirubin, cholesterol, inorganic phosphate, total protein, and urea; DNA damage in term of tail length, \% tail DNA, tail moment, and olive tail moment (OTM)], physiological disruption [whole body cortisol, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glucose], hematological profile [red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC)], and behav-ioral inconsistencies (hyperactiveness, hypoactiveness, equilibrium loss, rapid swimming, adapting ver-tical position, jumping, etc.). At acute concentration bifenthrin exposure induced stress, evaluated in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), which led to different subtle changes in the behavioral, biochemical, and hematological profile of grass carp. The current study explicates risks posed by bifenthrin on fish with underlying the possible mechanism of toxicity and supports the necessity to investigate multiple biomarkers-based toxicological endpoints in chemical risk assessment and safety analysis using fish as a model organism. Bifenthrin was classified as a highly toxic pesticide for grass carp. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

In this study, Rohu (Labeo rohita Hamilton) was subjected to the treatment with three sub-lethal concentrations (0.50, 1.00 and 1.5 ppb) of CYP for a total period of 96 h. The results obtained indicated significant stress in the studied fish due to pesticide intoxication. Pronounced effects of CYP on fish hematology included significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in white blood cells (WBCs), platelets and blood glucose level in treated group compared to control group. Conversely; however, substantial decrease in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb) level, hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was noticed among the treated group related to control group (p{\textless}0.05). Similarly, the histopathological lesions in the gills of exposed fish included lamellar disorder, disruption of cartilaginous core, epithelial lifting, blood mobbing, damage to secondary lamellae, fusion of secondary gills lamellae, twisting and shortening of secondary gills lamellae and degeneration and atrophy. While liver exhibited dissolution of cell membrane, Pyknosis, blood congestion, necrosis, hyperplasia and vacuolations; intestine was characterized by symptoms like necrosis, hemorrhages, over production of goblet cells in villi, disintegration, fusion and shortening of villi. In summary, we reported marked impacts of CYP on both hematological and histopathological traits of L. rohita. These, findings warrant that the indiscriminate use of CYP significantly increased WBCs, platelets and blood glucose level whereas it decreased RBCs, Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH and MCHC respectively. It also significantly affected the histopathology such as disruption of gills, liver and intestine architecture. (c) 2018 Friends Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {For a period of 1 year, some blood parameters were evaluated on a monthly basis in a population of adult European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) intensively reared in floating marine cages (Ionian Sea, Mediterranean). From April (13 months old) to July (16 months old) males (35-50\%) and sexually indeterminate individuals were collected. From August to March (24 months old) only males were sampled. During this period the percentage of spermiated males was highest (100\%) from November (20 months old) to January (22 months old). Plasma testosterone in males was inversely related to sunlight (h month(-1)) and was elevated between October and January, when males first achieved sexual maturity. Testosterone showed the highest value (0.49 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1)) in January and the lowest (0.09 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1)) in March. Haematocrit, red blood cell counts and haemoglobin concentration were elevated from November to March, being inversely related to sunlight. The two latter parameters were also inversely related to daily food intake. Haematocrit, red blood cell counts and haemoglobin concentration were highest in December [53 +/- 1\%, (5.36 +/- 0.06) x 10(6) mm(-3), 10.08 +/- 0.14 g 100 ml(-1), respectively] and lowest in June [35 +/- 1\%, (3.33 +/- 0.05) x 10(6) mm(-3), 6.47 +/- 0.13 g 100 ml(-1), respectively]. White blood cell counts were not correlated with sea water temperature, sunlight or daily food intake. They were highest in February [(8.45 +/- 0.20) x 10(4) mm(-3)] and lowest in April [(6.07 +/- 0.14) x 10(4) mm(-3)]. Total plasma protein concentration (4.88 +/- 0.11-5.93 +/- 0.10 g 100 ml(-1)) and mean cell volume (93.3 +/- 0.9-105.5 +/- 1.8 mum(3)) showed small fluctuations throughout the year. Sexual maturity appears to be a major factor that significantly affects haemopoiesis of D. labrax. This study contributes to the evaluation of normal levels of some blood parameters in European sea bass, which are helpful for the assessment of physiological status and health of this species.},

	abstract = {Haematological parameters of tench (Tinca tinca) infected by Saprolegnia spp. were studied. All parameters, except mean corpuscular volume (MCV), decreased in response to infection. A significant (P {\textless} 0.05) decrease was observed in haemoglobin (Hb) (-26.85\%), red blood cell count (RBCc) (-20.94\%), leucocrit (Lct) (-24.14\%), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (-9.06\%). Haematocrit (Hct), white blood cell count (WBCc), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) also decreased (-7.66\%, -12.44\%, and -6.19\%, respectively); however, differences between the infected and control groups were not significant. Among the parameters, only MCV had a non-significant increase (+7.84\%) in the infected fish. The study results show that saprolegniasis caused anaemia and immunosuppression, followed by mortality in tench. Mortality was attributed to haemodilution caused by haemorrhaging and the breakdown of osmotic balance due to tissue (skin and muscular layer) destruction via the penetration of the hyphae; however, lethargy was another mortality promoting factor. Mortality among the Saprolegnia-infected fish also depended upon the initial site of infection, type of tissue destroyed, growth rate of the fungus, and ability of individual fish to withstand the stress. The present study was conducted to investigate physiological impairment in Saprolegnia-infected Tinca tinca under laboratory conditions; however, further studies at the population level in natural habitats and under similar stress conditions are needed.},

The 96 h LC50 value of PCZ to the fish Labeo rohita was found to be 8.9 mu l L-1. Fish were exposed to 1/10th of 96 h LC50 value (0.89 mu l L-1) of PCZ for 28 days and the hematological, biochemical, ionoregulatory and gill Na+/K+-ATPase responses were evaluated at the end of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. The results revealed a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) decrease in red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), plasma protein and potassium levels, while the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), plasma sodium, chloride and glucose levels were increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) as compared to the control groups. Exposure with PCZ caused a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) inhibition in gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity. These results clearly indicate that that fungicide PCZ at sublethal concentration alter the hematological, biochemical and ionoregulatory parameters of fish and alterations of these parameters can be used as biomarkers for environmental monitoring of PCZ in aquatic environment.},

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of varying levels of dietary cyanocobalamin on growth, liver cyanocobalamin concentration, antioxidant capacity, intestinal enzymes and non-specific immune response and optimize dietary requirement for developing feeds for intensive culture of fingerling Channa punctatus. Seven purified diets (450 g/kg CP, 18.71 kJ/g GE) with 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg of cyanocobalamin were fed to fish (4.27 +/- 0.18 g) until satiation for 12-week. Maximum live weight gain (845\%), protein efficiency ratio (1.50), best feed conversion ratio (1.48), protein deposition (25.98\%) and protein gain (6.24 g/fish) were recorded in fish fed 0.08 mg cyanocobalamin per kg diet. Hematocrit, red blood cells, hemoglobin, mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin enhanced significantly with the increase of cyanocobalamin up to 0.08 mg/kg diet and then leveled off. However, intestinal protease, amylase and lipase activities increased (P {\textless} .05) as the amounts of dietary cyanocobalamin increased up to 0.16 mg/kg. Dietary cyanocobalamin levels significantly (P {\textless} .05) affected liver glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total serum protein, lysozyme and alkaline phosphatase activities which were found to be highest in fish fed 0.16 mg cyanocobalamin per kg diet. Liver cyanocobalamin concentrations increased linearly (P {\textless} .05) with the incremental doses of dietary cyanocobalamin. However, biometric indices including HSI and VSI all showed little difference (P {\textless} .05) among all the treatments while CF exhibited upward trend up to 0.08 mg/kg dietary cyanocobalamin. Live weight gain, feed conversion ratio, protein deposition, hematocrit, hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, protease and lipase activities were regressed against increasing concentrations of dietary cyanocobalamin using broken-line model which yielded the requirement in the range of 0.067-0.15 mg/kg diet. The information generated in this feeding trial will enable feed manufacturers to develop cyanocobalamin-balanced feeds for intensive culture of C. punctatus.},

Physiological changes in blood tissue [hematological indices: erythrocyte count (RBC), leukocyte count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (PLT), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and mean cell volume (MCV)], oxidative stress responses in liver and gill tissues [malondialdehyde (MDA) level, antioxidant enzyme activities: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GP(X)), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)] and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain tissue (as neurotoxic biomarker) were investigated. Additionally, behavioral differences were recorded by measuring swimming performance to support neurotoxic findings in all treatment groups. The LC(50)24 value of FDG-37 strain was determined through analysis as 1.0 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1). Inhibition of enzyme activity, increase in the MDA level, as well as significant differences in hematological indices and swimming performance were determined in rainbow trout treated with B compared to control and other bacterial groups in gills.

	abstract = {Pyrogallol is widely used in several industrial applications and can subsequently contaminate aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report for the first time the presence of pyrogallol in wastewater in Egypt. Currently, there is a complete lack of toxicity and carcinogenicity data for pyrogallol exposure in fish. To address this gap, both acute and sub-acute toxicity experiments were conducted to determine the toxicity of pyrogallol in catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Behavioral and morphological endpoints were evaluated, in addition to blood hematological endpoints, biochemical indices, electrolyte balance, and the erythron profile (poikilocytosis and nuclear abnormalities). In the acute toxicity assay, it was determined that the 96 h median-lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) of pyrogallol for catfish was 40 mg/L. In sub-acute toxicity experiment, fish divided into four groups; Group 1 was the control group. Group 2 was exposed to 1 mg/L of pyrogallol, Group 3 was exposed to 5 mg/L of pyrogallol, and Group 4 was exposed to 10 mg/L of pyrogallol. Fish showed morphological changes such as erosion of the dorsal and caudal fins, skin ulcers, and discoloration following exposure to pyrogallol for 96 h. Exposure to 1, 5, or 10 mg/L pyrogallol caused a significant decrease in hematological indices, including red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells (WBC), thrombocytes, and large and small lymphocytes in a dosedependent manner. Several biochemical parameters (creatinine, uric acid, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose) were altered in a concentration dependent manner with short term exposures to pyrogallol. Pyrogallol exposure also caused a significant concentration-dependent rise in the percentage of poikilocytosis and nuclear abnormalities of RBCs in catfish. In conclusion, our data suggest that pyrogallol should be considered further in environmental risk assessments of aquatic species.},

The activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as catalase (CAT) was stimulated in the hepatic tissue of O. niloticus exposed to PbNO3 and in those treated with A. platensis. Based on the results of serum bactericidal activity (SBA) and oxidative burst activity (OBA) assays as well as challenge tests with Aeromonas hydrophila, it was clear that supplementation with 5 or 10 g/kg A. platensis significantly enhanced the fish immune status and decreased the mortality rate (MR). However, these effects were reduced by PbNO3 exposure with no differences in MR percentage. Therefore, it was clear that O. niloticus reared in lead nitrate-polluted water were immunosuppressed, while diet supplementation with A. platensis could ameliorate such impacts.},

In order to understand the impact of acute hyperoxia on the fish immune system and peripheral tissues such as gills and gut, Senegalese sole juveniles (30.05 +/- 1.72 g) were exposed to normoxia (100\% O-2sat) as control and two hyperoxic conditions (150 and 200\% O-2sat) and sampled at 4 and 24 h. Fish haematological profile, total and differential blood cell counts and plasma immune parameters were analysed. Histomorphology and immunofluorescence analyses of gills and intestine were performed, respectively, whereas head-kidney samples were used for assessing the expression of immune-related genes. Results indicate that acute hyperoxia exposure may reduce fish erythrocyte and haemoglobin levels. Moreover, decreases in total leucocytes numbers, circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, alternative complement pathway activity and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 were observed in fish exposed to hyperoxia. In contrast, hyperoxia did not induce major effects on gill histomorphology nor in the protein content of ion and glucose cotransporters as well as a macrophage marker (V-ATPase) in the intestine. Although the activation of humoral mechanisms and immune-related genes were not dramatically affected by acute hyperoxia, the compromised immune cell status and the reduction of some inflammatory indicators are issues to consider under acute hyperoxia conditions.},

	abstract = {Adult lake whitefish were fed As contaminated diets at nominal concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 mug As/g food (dry weight) for 10, 30, and 64 days. Reduced feed consumption was observed in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food. beginning on day 45 of exposure. The accumulation and distribution of As in these fish are described in the previous manuscript [Pedlar, R.M., Klaverkamp, J.F., 2001. The accumulation and distribution of dietary arsenic in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). Aquat. Toxicol\_ in press]. At the molecular level of organization, metallothionein (MT) induction occurred in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food after 10 and 30 days, and in fish fed the 1 and 10 mug As/g diets for 64 days. Dietary As exposure did not have a significant effect on plasma lipid peroxide (LPO) concentrations. At the tissue and organ level, mean liver somatic index decreased significantly in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food for 64 days. Blood parameters (hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were not affected by exposure to As contaminated diets. Liver and gallbladder histopathologies were observed in lake whitefish fed all As contaminated diets after each duration of exposure. Histopathology observed in liver included nuclear, architectural and structural alterations, areas of inflammation, and focal necrosis. Sloughing of the epithelium, dilation of vascular elements, inflammation, edema, fibrosis, and increased width of the submucosa were some of the alterations observed in gallbladders of lake whitefish fed As contaminated diets. Both organs were sensitive to As exposure, as damage occurred with exposure to dietary concentrations of As as low as 1 mug/g. Whole organism parameters were unaltered by dietary As exposure. Based on the results of this study, histopathological alterations in liver and gallbladder, and hepatic MT induction may be useful indicators of As toxicity in environmental monitoring programs that also measure As concentrations in those tissues.

The present study was performed to evaluate the impact of various degrees of Thaparocleidus sp. (dactylogyrids, monogenean) infestation on haematological and serum biochemical parameters of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. A standard cohabitation study, following complete randomized design in triplicate, was conducted to obtain low, moderate and high degrees of infestation in P. hypophthalmus along with the control (uninfested) group. Blood and serum were studied for haematological (total erythrocyte count (TEC), haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total leucocyte count (TLC) and indices viz. mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and erythrocyte osmolarity brittleness (EOB)) and serum biochemical parameters (serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactate, total bilirubin and creatinine. Significant (p {\textless}0.05) increase in TEC, Hb, TLC, EOB, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, lactate, bilirubin, and creatinine were noticed in moderate to high monogenean-infested group in comparison to the control group. However, significant (p {\textless}0.05) reduction in MCH, and MCV and no difference (P{\textgreater} 0.05) in PCV were noticed in high degree parasitized group in comparison to the control group. The results of altered haematological and serum biochemical parameters in various degrees of monogenean-infested groups signify the density dependent physiological responses and changes in cells of the blood. The data of serum enzymes in the present study would be valuable for assessing the health status of the host and facilitate as a potential biomarker in relation to various degrees of monogenean infestation.

The present study evaluated the effects of azadirachtin EC 25\% on non-specific immune responses in goldfish Carassius auratus and resistance against pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. The experimental trial for effects of azadirachtin on immuno-haematoloical parameters in goldfish was conducted by feeding the various levels of azadirachtin as control To (without azadirachtin), T-1 (0.1\%), T-2 (0.2\%), T-3 (0.4\%), T-4 (0.8\%) and T-5 (1.6\%) for a period of 28 days. Fishes were challenged with A. hydrophila 28 days post feeding and relative percentage survival (\%) was recorded over 14 days post infection. Immuno-haematoloical (total erythrocyte count, total leukocyte count, haemoglobin, packed cell volume, NBT activity, phagocytic activity, serum lysozyme activity, myeloperoxidase activity, total immunoglobulin) and serum biochemical parameters (serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and blood glucose) of fishes were examined at 14 and 28 days of feedings. Fish fed with azadirachtin, showed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) enhanced TEC, TLC, Total Ig, total protein, NBT activity, serum lysozyme activity and myeloperoxidase level in different treatment groups in comparison with control group. Similarly, SGOT, SGPT and blood glucose level were found to be significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) high but PCV and Hb did not differ significantly (p {\textgreater} 0.05) in the treatment groups compared to control groups. Azadirachtin at the concentration of 4 g kg(-1) showed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher relative percentage survival (42.60\%) when compared with the control against A. hydrophila infection. This study indicated that azadirachtin EC 25\% (4 g kg(-1)) showed higher NBT activity, serum lysozyme, protein profiles, leukocyte counts and resistance against A. hydrophila infection and thus, can be used as a potential immunostimulant in aquaculture.

	abstract = {A feeding experiment was conducted to study the response of rainbow trout juveniles fed different levels of lupin meal in diets for rainbow trout juveniles. Very limited information is available on the relationship between dietary lupin meal in rainbow trout health status. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of lupin meal inclusion levels (0\%, 15\%, 30\%, 45\%, and 60\%) on growth performance and health status of rainbow trout juveniles. The experimental diets (LM0, LM15, LM30, LM45, and LM60) were formulated iso-nitrogenous (41\% crude protein) and iso-calorific (18\% crude lipid). The fish were fed twice a day. As a result, the best growth performance was observed in fish fed with LM15 and LM30 diets. No significant differences were detected among experimental groups in terms of body compositions. The haematological values showed significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower heamatocrit and mean cellular volume (MCV) in the group of LM60 compared with the other groups. For the other haematological parameters such as haemoglobin, red blood cell and mean cellular haemoglobin studied in the present study no significant differences were observed (p{\textless}0.05). The lupin meal included groups showed significant reduction in total protein (TPROT), triglyceride (TROG), cholesterol (CHOL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with the control group (p{\textless}0.05). The inclusion of lupin meal did not cause any changes in glucose (GLU), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) between the treatment groups (p{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, lupin meal might be used in rainbow trout diets up to 30\% without any malnutrition effect on growth performance, haemotological and serum biochemical parameters.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal contamination caused by human activities is a major threat to aquatic organisms. Therefore, a 28-day trial was designed to evaluate the hematological and histological changes in Labeo rohita exposed to chromium chloride. For this purpose, 240 fish (Labeo rohita) were randomly selected and divided into four groups. Three groups were treated with a sublethal waterborne concentration of chromium (37, 22, and 11 mgL(-1)); the fourth group was chromium-free control (0 mgL(-1)). Results demonstrated that noted values of hematological parameters, such as mean cell hemoglobin, red blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, and hemoglobin, were decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) in experimental groups compared with control, while mean cell volume and white blood cells were increased. On the 28th day, a decline was observed in white blood cell values. The severity of histological lesions in the liver, kidney, and gills increased as the concentration and duration of chromium exposure increased. No histological change was observed in the control (T-0), while T-1 showed more severe changes than T-2 and T-3. Those results suggest that long-term exposure to chromium chloride causes adverse effects on the hematology and histology of major carp, Labeo rohita.(c) 2023 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

	abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the acute toxicities of endosulfan on the hematopoietic, gastro-intestinal, respiratory systems of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 35 grass carp, 5-6 cm long were divided into five groups (E0, E1, E2, E3 and E4) having seven fish in each. The fish in group E0 were kept as control in plain water, while those in group E1, E2, E3 and E4 were exposed to 0.75, 1.00, 1.50 and 2.00 ppb of endosulfan in water, respectively for 96 hrs. Water and test chemical solution were renewed daily throughout the experiment. At the end of experimental period blood samples from fish in each group were collected. The morphometric parameters including total weight, length, standard length and organ weights showed non-significant difference. Samples from gills, intestine and liver were collected for the histopathological examination. A significant dose dependent decrease was noted in the leukocyte and erythrocyte counts, while the platelets were higher in the intoxicated fish. The values of Hb and PCV were also significantly lower in the high dosed group. There was fusion and disruption of gills along with severe congestion in the high dosed fish groups. The intestine showed atrophy of villi and increased goblet cells count. The hepatocytes showed degenerative changes including vacuolation, pyknosis etc. It was concluded that use of endosulfan in the water is extremely toxic for the fish health so a strong legislation must be implemented in the developing world as in the analogy of European Union.

Since fishes are the only group of vertebrate for which relationships between genome size and key cellular parameters are uncertain, the cytological correlates of genome size were examined in this group. The cell and nuclear areas of erythrocytes showed a highly significant positive correlation with each other and with genome size across 22 cartilaginous and 201 ray-finned fishes. Regressions remained significant at all taxonomic levels, as well as among different fish lineages. However, the results revealed that cartilaginous fishes possess higher cytogenomic ratios than ray-finned fishes, as do cold-water fishes relative to their warm-water counterparts. Increases in genome size owing to ploidy shifts were found to influence cell and nucleus size in an immediate and causative manner, an effect that persists in ancient polyploid lineages. These correlations with cytological parameters known to have important influences on organismal phenotypes support an adaptive interpretation for genome size variation in fishes.Key words: evolution, genome size, DNA content, cell size, erythrocyte size, fishes, nucleotypic effect.},

	abstract = {A comparative study has been made of haematological parameters (erythrocyte numbers, leucocyte numbers, haematocrit and haemoglobin), erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH and MCHC) and cytometric measurements (cell and nucleus) of 10 species of marine fish from the Visakhapatnam Coast, of which six are from harbour waters, three from rock pools and one from inshore waters. It is found that active fish have high values of erythrocyte numbers, haematocrit, haemoglobin and nucleo/cytoplasmic ratio and low values of leucocyte numbers and erythrocyte cytosome measurements. The most active of all is the inshore species
              Rastrelliger kanagurta
              depicting the haematological requirements of an active fish with high oxygen demand to meet the requirements of high metabolic rate. The other active fish such as
              Megalops cyprinoides
              and
              Mugil cephalus
              are intermediate, with the rock pool fish and
              Caranx carangus
              with low values of nucleo/cytoplasmic ratio at the other extreme.},
